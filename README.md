# Tux Barcode Tool

Hey there, I'm Tux Tech. I built **Tux Barcode Tool** to make generating custom barcodes super easy. This Python app sports a simple Tkinter GUI that lets you create all kinds of barcodes—including Code 128, QR Codes, and even Aztec Codes—with just a few clicks.

## What It Does

I designed this tool so you can:
- **Customize Your Barcode Payload:**  
  Simply enter a custom label, name, usage info, and extra notes. The app then formats all that data into a neat, human-readable string that gets encoded into your barcode.
- **Pick Your Barcode Format:**  
  - **Code 128 (small):** Perfect for compact, plain-text barcodes.
  - **QR Code:** Great for storing a lot more info.
  - **Aztec Code:** Ideal when you need to pack in tons of data in a small space.
- **See and Save Your Barcode:**  
  Once your barcode is generated, it shows up right in the app. And if you like what you see, you can save the final image—with your label underneath—directly to your desktop.

Enjoy making barcodes and QR codes effortlessly with Tux Barcode Tool!
